# Fast Food Nutrition Dashboard
Welcome to our Fast Food Nutrition Dashboard project! This readme provides an overview of our proposal, including the goals, data type, field of interest, and sources of data. We hope this document will help you understand our project and its potential benefits.

Project Overview
Our team, consisting of Breanna Mitchell, Megan Flinders, and Cody Lambach, aims to create a user-friendly dashboard that assists individuals in making informed choices regarding fast food restaurants and their nutritional value. The dashboard will leverage datasets obtained from Kaggle.com to present the data in a visually appealing and easily consumable format.

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of our project are as follows:

Nutritional Value Filtering: Users will have the ability to filter through specific fast food products and see the selected items nutritional value. For example, you can filter to a Big Mac and it will show you the cholesterol, sodium, total carbs, etc. 

Restaurant Comparison: The dashboard will allow users to compare the food options of different fast food restaurants. Through visualizations and data summaries, users can easily evaluate and contrast the nutritional values, fat content, sodium levels, and other relevant information across various establishments.

Data Type and Field of Interest
Our project focuses on the nutritional value of fast food chains. We will work with datasets obtained from Kaggle that provide comprehensive information about the nutritional content of fast food products. By utilizing this data, we aim to offer users valuable insights into the nutritional aspects of popular fast food restaurants.

How to Use the Dashboard
To make the most of our Fast Food Nutrition Dashboard, follow these steps:

Clone or download the project repository from GitHub link.

Install any necessary dependencies and ensure you have the required software versions mentioned in the project documentation.

Launch the dashboard application using the app.py file and running python app py. Click on the link that should show as or something similar to http://127.0.0.1:8000/. 

Once the dashboard loads, you will be presented with various filters and selection options.

Utilize the filters to narrow down the displayed data based on item or restuarant inquiring about.

Experiment with different filters and selection criteria to customize your experience and find the most suitable options for your dietary needs.

Enjoy the convenience of having fast food nutritional information readily available and make informed decisions about your food choices.

Conclusion
Our Fast Food Nutrition Dashboard aims to empower users with valuable information to make healthier choices when consuming fast food. By leveraging comprehensive datasets and providing intuitive filtering our dashboard will assist individuals in monitoring their nutritional intake effectively.

We hope that our project will not only enhance awareness of fast food nutrition but also encourage positive dietary habits. For any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.
